# Hello, there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MiguelRAvila/MiguelRAvila/master/img/profile/wave.gif" width="24px">

My interest in programming started when I was in high school.
While in high school I learnt HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6, PHP, SQL, MySQL and Python.

I am currently studying Electrical Engineering at NTNU in Trondheim, Norway.
In my bachelorâ€™s degree programme I will be working with arduinos and design circuit boards.
